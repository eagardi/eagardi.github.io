##Software Development II
####Final Paper

During my time in Software Development II I learned alot about the Ruby and Rails framework. That experience has taught me alot about how different technologies interact to make powerful web apps. During the entire process the most important thing that i learned is the MVC design. It was very frustrating to learn and understand.
